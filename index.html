      <h2>Krishna's Scratchpad on the Internet</h2>
      <p>Namaskaram!</p>
<p>I am Krishna, and I write a small blog on the Internet called - Krishna's Scratchpad on the Internet.</p>
<p>As someone who refrains from using modern social media, I find solace in my small personal corner of the internet, where my speech is neither constantly moderated nor subject to self-surveillance by social construct.</p>
<p>I am currently a student at the Institute of Law, Nirma University and I am keenly interested in becoming a career academic. Naturally, I am inclined towards the intersection between law, technology and constitutional rights or simply, 'Digital Constitutionalism'</p>
<p>If you you like to have a conversation about anything I have talked about here feel free to send me an email: krishnajani@posteo.com</p>
<p>I maintain an active library of music over at <a href="https://bandcamp.com/krsnaj">Bandcamp!</a></p>
<p>You may also access my CV <a href="./cv.pdf">here</a></p>
