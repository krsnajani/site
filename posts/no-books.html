<h1> On Book Debt </h1>
<h2 id="i-have-stopped-buying-books">I have stopped buying books</h2>
<p>Cleaning out and re-arranging my massive and constantly growing book
collection after the end of a stressful semester has now become a
custom, a tradition that I often look forward to. Its a few days of
being surrounded and swarmed by scores of bounded pages, and I like to
take my time opening and perusing through each title as a place it back
to its place in the shelf. I undertake this activity in the quiet of the
night, without music or podcasts playing in the background. The physical
labour that goes into sorting, and re-arranging heavy tomes keeps me
engaged throughout. Most importantly the company of books, and the quiet
of the night allows for peaceful introspection. During the exercise, I was  pleasantly surprised by
the number of books that had remained completely untouched, some for more than a decade! Their spines
had not cracked yet and the smell of the bookstore that I bought it from
still lingered.</p>
<p>I have always given into my impulse of ‘owning’ things. In that way,
I am a materialist in denial, because even though I am obsessed with
‘ownership’ I always tend to downplay my obsession and attachment with
‘things’. Nonetheless, I remain a materialist and by closing my eyes to
it, it wont unfortunately fade away. My library ritual this year made me
self-aware of this ‘collector’ habit. I was always obsessed with the
appearance of knowledge, as against knowledge itself. I am happy to pose
as a bookworm who reads extensively when in fact I have only read
(cover-to-cover) a measly 5% of the total strength of my library. I
always believed in the ‘buy-now read-later’ policy, because I was
convinced that eventually one day I would end up reading it, allowing me
to rationalise an indiscriminate spree of book buying that has
unfortunately lasted 20 years. Most of all, it is the ‘imposter
syndrome’, of posing as a pseudo-intellectual that scares me most and
fuels me to finish and repay my <b> book debt </b>.</p>
<p>The time is now. The days of deferring the actual hard task of
reading are now behind me and I have solemnly resolve to put a complete
ban on spending money on books indefinitely, i.e till I finish reading
cover-to-cover every book that I currently own. My current timeline is
arbitrarily set at a 1000 days from now. I will use my <a href="../books.html">books
	page</a> to maintain track of my progress. I intend to not
only read these books, but as far as practicable also put up notes and
quotes on the <a href="../posts.html">blog</a> as and when possible.</p>
<p>Signing Off.</p>
