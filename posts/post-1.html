                    <p>I am excited about developing an independent version of 'Krishna's Scratchpad'. Independent, because I own the platform and exercise complete control over it. As Hegel said - Property is an avenue for creativity. It is only when you own something, can you be truly creative and open. On platforms like Instagram, Meta and X, companies monetize human primal instincts (lust, anger and greed) to develop applications that become addictive, compulsive and intrusive. Selling personal privacy for the network effect is something that I strongly disapprove of, which is why I developed this platform. After many years of complete abstinence from the Internet, I realized that there must be a middle-ground. A place where I am able to express myself without having to commodify myself in the process.</p>
                    <p>The final product is a labor of love. I did not need to spend more than 40 mins to get the website up and running but that itself took me 6 months to properly master. So while the website is obviously <em>'low-effort'</em> it represents the time I spent in learning and developing a new skill--which is something I am proud of. I do not intend to change its appearance for <em>technical</em> reasons (<a href="https://youtu.be/cvDyQUpaFf4?si=s0FBl11rWUwp08f-" title="ref" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref</a>) and also because it requires <strong>work</strong> which I obviously don't have the will to do. I have primarily changed the margins and the font so that it looks <em>decent</em> and <em>presentable</em> but don't expect anything else :-)</p>
