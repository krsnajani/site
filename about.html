		<h1>About Me!</h1>
		<p> Haven't got a lot to say about myself because I am not so sure about what defines me yet. I think that introductions are 'self indulgent' and foreign as one is asked to observe themselves in third person. Its dissociative in that sense. Nonetheless, I am a student by profession (if you can call it that), a musician and a book collector <a href="posts/no-books.html">(ref)</a>. I am currently undergoing an undergraduate program in law after which I intend to pursue a post-graduate and PhD in law and allied disciplines. I am what is called an <i>aspiring academic</i>. Whether this is a socially ordained title that I have internalised or a real genuine interest? I cant figure out yet. I am scared that doing so would rat me out as an imposter. </p>
		<p> If you did go through the stream-of-consciousness gibberish above, here is a short list of places around the internet where you can find me </p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="mailto://krishnajani@posteo.com">Email</a></li>
			<p> I sure do hope to also reach a point in life where like Dr. Knuth I can say: 
			<blockquote cite="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/email.html">
				 I have been a happy man ever since January 1, 1990, when I no longer had an email address. I'd used email since about 1975, and it seems to me that 15 years of email is plenty for one lifetime.

				 Email is a wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on top of things. But not for me; my role is to be on the bottom of things. <b> What I do takes long hours of studying and uninterruptible concentration.

					 So if you want to write to me about any topic, please use good ol' snail mail and send a letter.</b>  I have a wonderful secretary who looks at the incoming postal mail and separates out anything that she knows I've been looking forward to seeing urgently. <i>(Emphasis Mine)</i>
		</blockquote> What a baller!
