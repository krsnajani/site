title: Krishna's Scratchpad on the Internet
---

Namaskaram!

I am Krishna, and I write a small blog on the Internet called - Krishna's Scratchpad on the Internet.

As someone who refrains from using modern social media, I find solace in my small personal corner of the internet, where my speech is neither constantly moderated nor subject to self-surveillance by social construct.

I am currently a student at the Institute of Law, Nirma University and I am keenly interested in becoming a career academic. Naturally, I am inclined towards the intersection between law, technology and constitutional rights or simply, 'Digital Constitutionalism'

If you you like to have a conversation about anything I have talked about here feel free to send me an email: krishnajani@posteo.com

I maintain an active library of music over at [Bandcamp!](https://bandcamp.com/krsnaj)
